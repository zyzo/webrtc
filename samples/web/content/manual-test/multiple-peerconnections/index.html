        Notes:
        <ul>
          <li>Due to https://code.google.com/p/webrtc/issues/detail?id=1203,
          you must create a data channel to actually get a call negotiated. Add
          one call at a time and click "add echoing data channel" for each and
          you'll be fine.</li>
          <li>For unknown reasons, adding a new data channel will clear the
          input field contents for all other channels on the same call. This is
          not the data channel's fault though.</li>
